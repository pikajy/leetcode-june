# [Symmetric Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/symmetric-tree/)

Given a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (ie, symmetric around its center).

**Example:**

    Input:  [1,2,2,3,4,4,3] is symmetric:

               1
              / \
             2   2
            / \ / \
           3  4 4  3

    Output: true

    Input:   [1,2,2,null,3,null,3] is not symmetric:

             1
            / \
           2   2
            \   \
            3    3

    Output: false
