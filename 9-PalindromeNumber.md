# [Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/)
Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.
**Example:**

    Input: 121 Output: true

    Input: -121 Output: false

    Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
